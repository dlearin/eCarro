# eCarro

Welcome to eCarro - a project aimed at creating a robot that will follow you based on your GPS coordinates. The eCarro is an Arduino-based robot equipped with GPS and Bluetooth modules, as well as an axis gyroscope orientation sensor. The robot will track your location via GPS coordinates obtained through a progressive web application that I will design. 

The eCarro robot is designed to be a helpful companion that will follow you wherever you go, freeing up your hands and allowing you to focus on other tasks. With its advanced GPS and orientation sensors, the eCarro will navigate complex environments with ease, making it the perfect solution for outdoor activities, such as hiking or camping.

## Installation

To build and program the eCarro robot, you will need the following hardware components:

- Arduino Uno or compatible microcontroller
- GPS module (such as the Adafruit Ultimate GPS breakout)
- Bluetooth module (such as the HM-10)
- Axis gyroscope orientation sensor (such as the MPU-6050)

You will also need the following software tools:

- Arduino IDE
- IDE

To install the eCarro project on your computer, follow these steps:

1. Clone the eCarro repository to your local machine.
2. Connect the hardware components according to the wiring diagram provided in the repository.
3. Open the `eCarro.ino` sketch file in the Arduino IDE and upload it to your microcontroller.
4. Build the progressive web application using the provided code and tools.
5. Connect your Android device to the Bluetooth module and run the web application to start tracking your location.

## Usage

To use the eCarro robot, follow these steps:

1. Turn on the robot and ensure that it is connected to the GPS and Bluetooth modules.
2. Start the progressive web application on your Android device and input your desired destination coordinates.
3. The robot will begin to follow you based on your GPS coordinates and orientation, allowing you to move freely while it tracks your location.
